## Resolved Bugs

### BUG-001 - Example: Database Connection Timeout
**Status:** Resolved  
**Priority:** High  
**Date Reported:** 2025-01-15  
**Date Resolved:** 2025-01-16

#### Description
Database queries were timing out after 30 seconds under load.

#### Root Cause
Default connection pool size was too small (5 connections). Under high load, requests were queuing and timing out.

#### Solution
Increased connection pool size to 20 connections and added connection timeout configuration:
```typescript
// config/database.ts
poolSize: 20,
connectionTimeoutMillis: 5000,
```

#### Prevention
- Added performance testing to CI/CD
- Documented connection pool sizing in architecture_decisions.md
- Added monitoring alerts for connection pool exhaustion
