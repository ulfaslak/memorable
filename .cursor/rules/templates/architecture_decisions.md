# Architecture Decisions Record (ADR)

> **Purpose:** Document WHY architectural decisions were made. This persists when chat context is lost.

## Decision 1: [Decision Title]
**Date:** [YYYY-MM-DD]  
**Status:** Accepted | Proposed | Deprecated

### Context
What problem are we trying to solve? What constraints exist?

### Decision
What did we decide to do?

### Rationale
Why did we make this choice?
- Reason 1
- Reason 2
- Reason 3

### Alternatives Considered
What else did we consider and why did we reject it?
- **Alternative A:** Why rejected
- **Alternative B:** Why rejected

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Benefits of this decision
- **Negative:** Trade-offs or limitations
- **Risks:** Potential future issues

## Example Decisions (Remove when you add real ones)

### Decision: Use Repository Pattern for Data Access
**Date:** 2025-01-15  
**Status:** Accepted

### Context
Need consistent way to access data across the application. Multiple data sources might be needed in future.

### Decision
Implement Repository Pattern with interfaces for all data access operations.

### Rationale
- Decouples business logic from data access
- Makes testing easier with mock repositories
- Allows switching data sources without changing business logic
- Industry standard pattern for this type of application

### Alternatives Considered
- **Direct database calls:** Rejected - creates tight coupling
- **Active Record pattern:** Rejected - mixes concerns, harder to test

### Consequences
- **Positive:** Clean separation of concerns, testable, flexible
- **Negative:** More files to maintain, slight overhead
- **Risks:** Team must understand the pattern to maintain consistency

## Template for New Decisions

When adding a new architectural decision:
1. Copy the template at the top
2. Fill in all sections
3. Link to relevant code examples in coding_standards.md
4. Update api_contracts.md if this affects interfaces
